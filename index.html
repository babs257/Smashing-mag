              <h4>By Ryan DeBeasi</h4>

              <h4>By Philip Kiely</h4>
              <p>Speech-to-text promises to save time transcribing long audio sources like podcasts and interviews.

              <h2>How To Ensure Your Design System Helps To Achieve The Purpose Of Your Product</h2>
              <h4>By Nick Babich</h4>
              <p>Design is increasingly becoming more complex. Design processes require having a tight cross-functional collaboration between all teams involved in the creation of the product.

              <p>Rémi Parmentier (@HTeuMeuLeu) is a french front-end developer working at his own small web development agency, Tilt Studio. He loves to learn and enjoys even more to teach. This led him on a joyful quest to understand and demistify HTML emails coding. Rémi runs workshops, gives talks, and writes articles on his blog to help others build better HTML emails. Inspired by caniuse.com, he recently launched Can I email…, a handy resource with support tables for using HTML and CSS in emails. Thank you for sharing and caring, dear Rémi!</p>
